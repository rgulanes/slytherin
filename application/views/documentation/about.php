Slytherin is a simple and easy to understand PHP skeleton framework that uses a Model-View-Controller (MVC) software pattern. Unlike other other frameworks
that provides big libraries that is unnecessary in building your wep application or site, Slytherin uses Composer to add, update or even remove external
