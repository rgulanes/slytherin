/**
 * Application Routes
 * 
 * Here is where you can register all of the routes for an application.
 *
 * If your controller has one or more of the following methods: 
 * 	create(), destroy(), edit(), index(), show(), store(), and update()
 * You don't need to include them here, the routing for them is already done by Slytherin.
 *
 * "Pux" was used as the router for Slytherin. For more information on
 * how to create a route, just go here: http://c9s.github.io/Pux
