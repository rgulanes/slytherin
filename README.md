###Slytherin PHP Framework

A small and simple PHP framework for PHP that is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) development pattern. Unlike the other frameworks that provides big libraries that you don't need in developing your web applications, this framework utilizes [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to add, update or even remove external libraries with ease.
